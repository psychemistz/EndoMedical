# TECH 565 Business Opportunity Outline

---

## 1. Describe Your Technology

**Summary of Technology:**  

Our technology is a **dedicated transcaval closure device** engineered to close the aorto-caval tract created during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with inadequate femoral access. Unlike repurposed nitinol occluders, our device is purpose-built to provide secure, hemostatic closure, minimizing complications such as bleeding and device “pull-through.” It is designed for optimal deliverability through a 14–16Fr sheath, precisely targeting the unique anatomy of the aorto-caval space.

**NIH Abstract: https://www.techtransfer.nih.gov/tech/tab-4543**  
"This project aims to develop a novel transcaval closure device specifically designed for structural heart interventions in high-risk patients undergoing TAVR. Current practice relies on off-label use of occluders intended for other indications, leading to suboptimal outcomes including incomplete immediate sealing and increased bleeding risks. Our device leverages advanced materials and a unique deployment mechanism to achieve rapid, secure closure of the aorto-caval tract. Early feasibility studies, including a first-in-human trial, have demonstrated 100% successful closure with no vascular complications at 30 days. This technology has the potential to expand TAVR eligibility, reduce procedural risks, and ultimately improve patient outcomes."

## 2. What Unmet Need Does Your Project Address?

Our device addresses a **critical unmet need** in structural heart interventions—specifically, the absence of a dedicated transcaval closure solution for patients undergoing TAVR who lack suitable femoral access. Current clinical practice forces physicians to use off-label devices, leading to risks like incomplete sealing and significant bleeding. Clinicians and hospitals will opt for our device because it:

- **Enhances Patient Safety:** Provides immediate, secure closure to reduce procedural complications.
- **Expands Treatment Eligibility:** Enables TAVR in patients previously denied treatment due to vascular limitations.
- **Reduces Need for Invasive Alternatives:** Minimizes the requirement for surgical approaches that are more invasive and riskier.

## 3. Who Are Your Ultimate Customers and Who Will Pay for It?

**Ultimate Customers:**

- **Hospitals & Cardiac Centers:** Particularly those with high TAVR volumes and advanced structural heart programs.
- **Interventional Cardiologists & Vascular Surgeons:** Specialists performing TAVR and other complex cardiovascular procedures.

**Who Pays for It:**

- **Hospitals/Healthcare Systems:** The device cost is bundled into the overall procedural expense for TAVR.
- **Insurance Providers (including Medicare):** Reimbursement will be provided as part of the procedural payment package, especially if improved outcomes and reduced complications are demonstrated.

**Price Sensitivity & Market Support:**

- The market is accustomed to premium pricing for specialized structural heart implants.
- A pricing range around **$5,000 per device** is justified by the device's ability to reduce complications and enable life-saving procedures, making it an economically attractive proposition despite its premium cost.
