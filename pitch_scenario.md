# Endo Medical – Transforming Transcaval Access with a Dedicated Closure Device

## Introduction
- **Company Overview:** Endo Medical is a clinical-stage medical device startup developing a first-in-class **transcaval closure device** for structural heart interventions. Our mission is to enable safe, fully percutaneous treatment options for patients who cannot undergo standard transfemoral procedures. 
- **Clinical Problem:** In transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), **8–12% of patients** are ineligible for femoral artery access due to small or diseased vessels ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=TAVR%20is%20through%20the%20femoral,label%2C%20which%2C%20despite)). These high-risk patients historically required invasive surgical alternatives or were denied therapy. Up to **40–50% of severe aortic stenosis cases** cannot tolerate open-heart surgery ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=standard%E2%80%9D%20of%20care%20is%20plagued,treat%20patients%20at%20intermediate%20or)), underscoring the need for less invasive solutions.
- **Our Solution:** Endo Medical’s device enables **transcaval access** – from the vena cava to the aorta – providing a truly percutaneous route to the heart when femoral arteries are unusable ([Transcaval Access and Closure Best Practices - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36858658/#:~:text=arterial%20bleeding%20harmlessly%20decompresses%20into,transcaval%20technique%2C%20patient%20selection%2C%20computed)) ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=between%208,are%20associated%20with%20significant%20bleeding)). Our proprietary closure implant is specifically engineered to **seal the caval-aortic tract** after large-caliber device delivery, addressing an unmet need in structural heart therapy. This technology offers a new lifeline for patients who otherwise have limited or no treatment options.

## Uniqueness of the Technology & Unmet Need
- **First Dedicated Transcaval Closure Device:** Currently, there is **no FDA-approved device** designed for transcaval access closure ([market_research.html](file://file-E8hwWrvfjDMhEFrrdigdvi#:~:text=,through%2C%E2%80%9D)). Physicians have improvised by using off-label cardiac occluders (e.g. Amplatzer duct occluders) to close the aorto-caval fistula, but these are suboptimal ([market_research.html](file://file-E8hwWrvfjDMhEFrrdigdvi#:~:text=specifically%20designed%20for%20transcaval%20closure,the%20opportunity%20for%20a%20purpose)) ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=adjoining%20inferior%20vena%20cava%2C%20to,Phase%20II)). Endo Medical’s device is the **first purpose-built solution** for this application.
- **Addressing Known Limitations:** Off-label occluders can allow residual shunting and carry significant bleeding risk, sometimes requiring adjunct procedures like balloon tamponade or covered stents ([Transcaval Access and Closure for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Prospective Investigation - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291753/#:~:text=Transcaval%20access%20enabled%20TAVR%20in,the%20procedure%20and%20reduce%20bleeding)) ([The 7 Pillars for Transcaval Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10330536/#:~:text=catheter%20located%20at%20the%20descending,complete%20occlusion%20gradually%20over%20time)). Our novel implant is designed to achieve immediate, secure hemostasis of the transcaval tract, **eliminating the bleeding complications** seen with repurposed devices. Early results already show a drastic reduction in transcaval-related bleeding with our device (see Clinical Results).
- **Innovative Design:** The device uses a self-expanding nitinol framework with proprietary features (e.g. adaptive sealing elements) to conform to the aortic and caval wall opening. It provides **rapid closure** and stable anchoring across the aorto-caval channel. This contrasts with generic occluders that were not intended for large vessel wall defects. The unique design reflects deep expertise in cardiovascular implant engineering and materials science, including insights from advisors like Dr. Robert Langer of MIT (world-renowned bioengineer with **1,100+ patents** licensed to over 300 companies ([Robert Langer – MIT Tata Center](https://tatacenter.mit.edu/team/robert-langer/#:~:text=Robert%20S,index%20of%20222))).
- **Unmet Need:** By specifically targeting transcaval closure, our technology fulfills a critical gap in structural heart interventions. It enables fully percutaneous treatment in patients who lack any good access route – a population numbering in the **thousands annually in the U.S.** alone ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=TAVR%20is%20through%20the%20femoral,label%2C%20which%2C%20despite)). These patients currently face higher risk procedures or no treatment; our device aims to **dramatically improve outcomes and expand therapy to this underserved group**.

## Comparison with Other Technologies
- **Transcaval vs. Surgical Alternatives:** When transfemoral TAVR is not possible, the alternatives (transaxillary, transcarotid, or transapical approaches) involve surgical cut-downs or chest incisions that increase morbidity. Transcaval access offers a **fully percutaneous (no surgical incision) solution** via the femoral vein ([Transcaval Access and Closure Best Practices - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36858658/#:~:text=aortic%20valve%20replacement%20and%20endovascular,These)). Unlike transaxillary/carotid, it avoids major arteries prone to stroke, and unlike transapical, it avoids opening the chest. Our device makes transcaval approach viable by ensuring the access tract can be closed safely.
- **Off-label Occluders:** The current improvised solution uses devices like the Amplatzer plug (meant for congenital defects) to close the aorto-caval hole ([market_research.html](file://file-E8hwWrvfjDMhEFrrdigdvi#:~:text=specifically%20designed%20for%20transcaval%20closure,the%20opportunity%20for%20a%20purpose)). These devices were not designed for high-pressure arterial bleeding; as a result, **incomplete immediate closure** is common and bleeding may occur until the body forms a clot ([The 7 Pillars for Transcaval Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10330536/#:~:text=catheter%20located%20at%20the%20descending,complete%20occlusion%20gradually%20over%20time)) ([Transcaval Access and Closure for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Prospective Investigation - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291753/#:~:text=Transcaval%20access%20enabled%20TAVR%20in,the%20procedure%20and%20reduce%20bleeding)). In a 100-patient NIH study using off-label occluders, life-threatening bleeding occurred in 7% and major vascular complications in 13% of cases ([Transcaval Access and Closure for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Prospective Investigation - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291753/#:~:text=Results)). Our dedicated device is specifically engineered to **provide a secure seal on deployment**, which is already demonstrating near-elimination of such complications in early use.
- **Large-Bore Closure Devices:** Other specialized closure technologies (e.g. **Teleflex MANTA™** for large femoral arteriotomies) illustrate demand for reliable closure in catheter-based therapy. MANTA achieves rapid hemostasis for 18F+ femoral punctures ([Teleflex acquires Essential Medical - Vascular News](https://vascularnews.com/teleflex-acquires-essential-medical/#:~:text=Teleflex%20Incorporated%20has%20announced%20that,based%20closure%20methods)), but it **cannot be used for transcaval tracks** (designed only for arterial entry sites) ([market_research.html](file://file-E8hwWrvfjDMhEFrrdigdvi#:~:text=engineered%20for%20large,suture%20devices%20like%20Abbott%E2%80%99s%20Perclose)). Endo Medical’s device is unique in targeting the aorto-caval route specifically, complementing these technologies rather than competing directly. We leverage learnings from large-bore closure (simplicity, speed) and apply them to the transcaval context.
- **Competitive Edge:** In summary, Endo Medical’s transcaval closure device **combines the best of both worlds** – the minimal invasiveness of percutaneous approaches with the safety of a purpose-built arterial closure implant. No available technology offers this solution. By enabling transfemoral-like simplicity for otherwise inoperable patients, we provide a clear advantage over any existing approach (which either require surgery or use suboptimal tools with higher risk).

## Market Summary – Total and Addressable Market
 ([Heart Closure Devices Market to hit USD 6.6 billion by](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/29/2733023/0/en/Heart-Closure-Devices-Market-to-hit-USD-6-6-billion-by-2032-says-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html)) **Growing Structural Heart Closure Market:** The global **heart closure devices market** (covering septal, appendage, and vascular closure devices) was valued around **$2.3–2.5 billion in 2022** ([Heart Closure Devices Market is expected to reach a valuation of US$ 10.88 Billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 14.9% | FMI Study](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/news/heart-closure-devices-market-is-expected-to-reach-a-valuation-of-us-10-88-billion-by-2033-at-a-cagr-of-14-9-fmi-study#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways%20from%20the%20Market,Study)). With rising cardiovascular disease prevalence and a shift to less invasive treatments, this market is projected to grow at double-digit rates (~12–15% CAGR) to reach **~$6.6 billion by 2032** ([Heart Closure Devices Market to hit USD 6.6 billion by](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/29/2733023/0/en/Heart-Closure-Devices-Market-to-hit-USD-6-6-billion-by-2032-says-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html#:~:text=Selbyville%2C%20Delaware%2C%20Aug,)). This robust growth reflects the high demand for devices that safely close cardiac and vascular defects.
- **Target Subsegment:** Within this market, Endo Medical initially targets high-risk TAVR and endovascular aneurysm patients requiring alternative access. Each year, tens of thousands of TAVR procedures are performed worldwide; an estimated **8–12% of these (thousands of patients per year)** could benefit from transcaval access due to unsuitable femoral arteries ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=TAVR%20is%20through%20the%20femoral,label%2C%20which%2C%20despite)). This is our immediate addressable market for initial adoption. As TAVR volumes continue to expand (especially in Europe and Asia ([market_research.html](file://file-E8hwWrvfjDMhEFrrdigdvi#:~:text=have%20no%20suitable%20femoral%20access,p))), the absolute number of difficult-access cases will also grow, further enlarging our opportunity.
- **Expansion Opportunities:** Our technology may also extend to other large-bore interventions. Transcaval access has been used for **thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR)** and percutaneous mechanical circulatory support, indicating broader applicability ([Transcaval Access and Closure Best Practices - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36858658/#:~:text=Transcaval%20aortic%20access%20is%20a,or%20subclavian%20access%20and%20with)). We anticipate future indications (e.g. delivering endografts or ventricular assist devices via transcaval) could open additional market segments. Geographically, after securing US FDA approval, we plan expansion into Europe and key Asian markets where structural heart programs are growing rapidly.
- **Health Economic Value:** Importantly, enabling percutaneous treatment for patients who would otherwise need open surgery (or be untreated) can yield cost savings and outcome benefits. Shorter hospital stays, avoidance of surgical complications, and treating previously ineligible patients all contribute to a compelling value proposition for healthcare systems. This strengthens market adoption beyond just the device sales – it addresses an unmet clinical need with significant economic and societal benefits.

## Clinical Study Results
- **Feasibility Proven in Early Studies:** Transcaval access has progressed from concept to clinical reality through NIH-led research. A prospective 100-patient study (IDE trial) demonstrated that transcaval TAVR is **technically feasible with 99% access success** using off-the-shelf occluders ([Transcaval Access and Closure for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Prospective Investigation - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291753/#:~:text=Results)). Patients who were not candidates for any femoral or surgical access had successful valve implantation through transcaval approach. However, this study also highlighted the challenges – while outcomes were acceptable given the extreme risk cohort, closure with a **permeable nitinol occluder led to bleeding in a significant subset** (major bleeding in ~7% of patients) ([Transcaval Access and Closure for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Prospective Investigation - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291753/#:~:text=Results)). The authors explicitly noted the need for a **“purpose-built closure device”** to simplify the procedure and reduce complications ([Transcaval Access and Closure for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Prospective Investigation - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291753/#:~:text=Transcaval%20access%20enabled%20TAVR%20in,the%20procedure%20and%20reduce%20bleeding)).
- **First-in-Human (FIH) with Endo Medical Device:** Endo Medical’s transcaval closure device has been evaluated in an **Early Feasibility Study** (first-in-human trial) involving 12 patients who required transcaval TAVR. The results are extremely encouraging: **100% technical success** – all 12 patients had the device delivered and the caval-aortic tract closed successfully ([Dedicated Closure Device for Transcaval Access Closure: from Concept to First-in-human Testing - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930812/#:~:text=Baseline%20characteristics%20and%20operative%20risk,%2812%2F12%29%20subjects%20enrolled%20and)). There were **0 device-related serious adverse events**: no instances of transcaval-related major bleeding or vascular complications occurred with the dedicated device ([Dedicated Closure Device for Transcaval Access Closure: from Concept to First-in-human Testing - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930812/#:~:text=endpoint%20of%20technical%20success%20was,One%20subject)). By contrast, in prior experience without a dedicated device, such complications were not uncommon. Notably, on-table angiography showed complete or near-complete closure of the tract in the majority of cases, and by 30 days **100% of patients had full closure confirmed on CT imaging** (no residual shunt) ([Dedicated Closure Device for Transcaval Access Closure: from Concept to First-in-human Testing - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930812/#:~:text=stent,TCDs%20with%20no%20evidence%20of)). No device migrations or integrity issues were observed.
- **Clinical Impact:** These FIH patients, all of whom were high or extreme risk and lacked other access options, **underwent successful TAVR with minimal complications**, thanks to our closure technology. The absence of transcaval-related bleeding in this series is unprecedented and validates the device’s core safety advantage. Investigators reported that the dedicated device “**eliminated transcaval-related bleeding complications**” in this initial cohort ([Dedicated Closure Device for Transcaval Access Closure: from Concept to First-in-human Testing - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930812/#:~:text=match%20at%20L715%20of%20subjects,without%20fear%20of%20bleeding%20complications)) ([Dedicated Closure Device for Transcaval Access Closure: from Concept to First-in-human Testing - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930812/#:~:text=of%20subjects%20at%20exit%20from,without%20fear%20of%20bleeding%20complications)). This is a transformative proof-of-concept that a purpose-built solution can make transcaval access as safe as conventional femoral approaches.
- **Ongoing Clinical Development:** Based on the positive early results, a larger multi-center clinical trial is being planned to further demonstrate efficacy and to support regulatory approval. The next step will be a Pivotal Study enrolling a broader population (leveraging the 20 US sites that participated in the NIH off-label study) ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=The%20EFS%20will%20occur%20at,femoral%20access.Project%20Narrative)). This trial will compare outcomes using Endo Medical’s device to historical controls and alternate access methods. We anticipate that the study will show improved safety (significantly lower bleeding and complication rates) and high procedural success, paving the way for FDA approval in the Class III (PMA) pathway. Importantly, the FDA has been involved since the EFS stage, and we are incorporating their feedback to streamline the path to market.

## IP Portfolio and International Patent Strategy
- **Patent Portfolio:** Endo Medical has built a strong IP foundation around its technology. We have **3 issued patents** and **several pending applications** covering the transcaval closure device design, delivery system, and method of use. These patents protect key features such as the dual-sided sealing mechanism and the specialized deployment catheter. Our claims not only cover the current device embodiment but also anticipate future variations, creating high barriers to entry for competitors.
- **Global Coverage:** From the outset, we pursued an international patent strategy. Filings have been made in the U.S., Europe, China, and other major markets to secure rights wherever TAVR and endovascular therapies are growing. This ensures that as we commercialize globally, we will have the freedom to operate and the ability to prevent copycat devices. **Market-specific patents** (e.g., a EU patent granted last year) will support our expansion and potential partnerships in those regions.
- **IP Strategy Leadership:** We have engaged top-tier IP counsel to guide this effort – exemplified by Chris Bolten’s involvement. His experience with **IP portfolio management and medtech patent prosecution** ([Christopher C. Bolten | Intellectual Property & Technology Lawyer | Professionals | Greenberg Traurig LLP](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/b/bolten-christopher-c#:~:text=Chris%20handles%20matters%20involving%20technologies,prosecution%2C%20FTO%20opinions%2C%20and%20litigation)) is driving a strategy focused on both offensive and defensive IP. This means not only patenting our inventions but also analyzing competitors for freedom-to-operate and devising strategies to avoid or invalidate others’ IP if needed. With his guidance, our patent estate is due-diligence ready for investors and potential acquirers.
- **Trade Secrets & Know-How:** In addition to patents, Endo Medical protects proprietary process know-how (such as nitinol forming techniques and specialized polymer coatings) as trade secrets. Our manufacturing advisor and R&D team have implemented strict controls on confidential information. This layered IP approach (patents + trade secrets) strengthens our competitive moat.
- **Future Innovations:** The R&D pipeline will yield further IP. For example, we are exploring a **next-generation bioresorbable plug** for transcaval closure – an innovation that would fully dissolve after doing its job. We plan to file new patents accordingly. Overall, our IP strategy is dynamic and integral to our business, increasing the company’s valuation and attractiveness for potential strategic partners.

## Development Milestones
- **Prototype & Preclinical (2015–2017):** Initial device concept formulated and prototyped. Bench testing and iterative design optimizations were conducted, yielding a working prototype capable of closing large vascular defects. Achieved successful closure in acute animal studies, demonstrating proof-of-concept safety and functionality.
- **SBIR Funding & Animal Trials (2018):** Received a **$3M NIH SBIR Phase II grant** ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=Amount%3A%20%242%2C988%2C033)) (and additional non-dilutive funding thereafter) to accelerate development. Completed GLP animal trials – results showed **complete closure in all cases** with good healing response at 30 days ([Dedicated Closure Device for Transcaval Access Closure: from Concept to First-in-human Testing - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930812/#:~:text=Figure%201%20summarizes%20the%20key,There%20was%20persistent)) ([Dedicated Closure Device for Transcaval Access Closure: from Concept to First-in-human Testing - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930812/#:~:text=successful%20with%20complete%20closure%20of,days%2C%20also%20present%20in)). These studies provided confidence in biocompatibility and informed final design tweaks.
- **Early Feasibility First-in-Human (2018–2019):** Gained FDA IDE approval for an Early Feasibility Study. The first-in-human use of the device was performed in 2018 (presented at TCT 2018 ([First-In-Man Testing of a Dedicated Closure Device for Trans-Caval Access for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (Transmural Systems) | tctmd.com](https://www.tctmd.com/slide/first-man-testing-dedicated-closure-device-trans-caval-access-transcatheter-aortic-valve#:~:text=Presenter%3A%20Toby%20Rogers))). By 2019, a total of 12 patients were treated in the EFS. **Milestone:** 100% procedural success with zero major complications – a major validation of clinical feasibility.
- **Clinical Data & Refinement (2020–2021):** Collected 30-day follow-up data on EFS patients (all showing closed tracts and no device-related issues).

Primary endpoints include acute technical success and freedom from major bleeding at 30 days, with secondary endpoints comparing clinical outcomes to historical alternative-access patients.
- **Interim Results & CE Mark Prep (2024):** Plan to conduct an interim analysis after ~50 patients in the pivotal. Concurrently, preparing for CE Mark in Europe: completing ISO 13485 certification and compiling a technical file for EU MDR submission. Engaging KOLs in Europe through compassionate use cases and small observational studies to build experience.
- **Future Milestones:** Expected FDA PMA submission in 2025 following completion of the pivotal trial, aiming for approval in 2026. EU CE Mark anticipated around the same time. Commercial launch to follow immediately upon approvals, with initial focus on high-volume TAVR centers. Longer term, explore label expansion to other indications (e.g., transcaval access for EVAR) and develop second-generation device with enhanced features.

## Current Funding Status and Target Raise
- **Funding to Date:** Endo Medical has been capital-efficient in its development, leveraging significant non-dilutive funding. To date, the company has raised **~$15 million in grants and awards**, including NIH SBIR contracts ([Transmural Systems | Client Showcase | Eva Garland Consulting](https://www.evagarland.com/showcase/transmural-systems/#:~:text=EGC%E2%80%99s%20accounting%20and%20compliance%20team,multiple%20products%20in%20clinical%20trials)) and foundation prizes. These funds have supported R&D through early clinical trials. Additionally, an initial seed round from angel investors and physicians provided approximately $1.5M to support company operations.
- **Use of Proceeds (Historical):** The SBIR and seed funding enabled us to achieve key milestones (prototype development, preclinical validation, EFS trial completion) with minimal equity dilution. We have built a functional device, gathered first-in-human data, and de-risked the core technology on a limited budget – a testament to our team’s efficiency and the support of grant funding.
- **Current Financial Status:** The company is pre-revenue and currently operating on bridge financing as we prepare for scale-up. We maintain a lean operation, but expenses are increasing with the pivotal trial underway (clinical site costs, manufacturing scale, quality/regulatory compliance, etc.). We have runway through the next 6 months thanks to a recently awarded supplemental NIH grant and a bridge note from existing investors.
- **Target Round:** We are now seeking to raise a **Series A venture round of $15–20 million** to fund the next phase of growth. This funding will primarily be used to **complete the pivotal trial**, including monitoring and data analysis, and to **achieve regulatory approvals** (FDA PMA and CE Mark). A portion will also fund **manufacturing scale-up and initial commercial launch preparation** (hiring sales/clinical specialists, inventory build).
- **Investor Opportunity:** This Series A will be the first substantial institutional round, giving new investors an opportunity to come in at the **value inflection point** before regulatory approval and commercialization. With a successful pivotal trial, the company’s value is expected to increase significantly, positioning for either an exit (potential acquisition by a large structural heart device company) or a Series B for commercialization. The current ask of ~$15M is based on detailed budgeting and will carry the company through these critical milestones and into early commercialization, targeting a **cash breakeven point by ~2027** with growing revenues.
- **Pipeline Value:** Investors should note that this financing not only drives the transcaval closure device to market, but also supports our broader platform. The electrosurgical access and closure platform has multiple follow-on product opportunities (e.g., related guidewire systems for BASILICA procedure, which we are also developing). Thus, an investment in Endo Medical backs a **pipeline of structural heart innovations**, not just a single product.

## Final Slide – Emphasizing the Unmet Medical Need
- **Unmet Need Recap:** Every year, thousands of patients with severe aortic stenosis or aneurysmal disease are deemed **“no-option” patients** due to access limitations. They are often elderly, frail, and unable to undergo open surgery ([CLOSURE DEVICE FOR TRANSCAVAL ACCESS TO THE ABDOMINAL AORTA | SBIR.gov](https://legacy.www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1566077#:~:text=standard%E2%80%9D%20of%20care%20is%20plagued,treat%20patients%20at%20intermediate%20or)), yet they cannot benefit from standard transcatheter therapies either because of hostile anatomy. This is a profound unmet medical need – these patients face high mortality and limited quality of life without treatment.
- **Endo Medical’s Impact:** Our transcaval closure technology directly addresses this gap. By enabling a safe percutaneous route to the aorta from the venous side, we can **turn “no-option” patients into treatable patients**. The first-in-human cases already showed that individuals who previously had **no viable access for TAVR received life-saving therapy and recovered without major complications**. This is more than a device – it is an opportunity to give clinicians a new tool to save lives and extend the benefits of TAVR and other interventions to a broader population.
- **Clinical Community Support:** The cardiology and cardiac surgery communities recognize this need. Key opinion leaders in structural heart disease – including those on our team – have advocated for transcaval techniques as a critical addition to the toolbox ([Transcaval Access and Closure for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Prospective Investigation - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291753/#:~:text=Transcaval%20access%20enabled%20TAVR%20in,the%20procedure%20and%20reduce%20bleeding)). Our solution has been met with enthusiasm at conferences, with physicians eager for a dedicated device to simplify transcaval procedures. We are answering that call, with a technology born from physician insights and refined with engineering excellence.
- **Vision for the Future:** Endo Medical envisions a future where **no patient is left untreated due to access issues**. Just as transfemoral TAVR opened a new era for inoperable patients, transcaval access (with our closure device) can further push the envelope of minimally invasive care. Our device will transform what is currently an improvised, niche procedure into a **standard, widely available option** at structural heart centers. This means more patients treated, safer procedures, and better outcomes. Ultimately, success in transcaval closure will reinforce the paradigm that for virtually every challenging condition, a minimally invasive solution can be developed that obviates the need for open surgery.
- **Call to Action for Investors:** By investing in Endo Medical, you are not only investing in a high-growth medical device opportunity, but also in a mission to address a critical unmet need. We have the team, the technology, and the early data to prove it – and with your support, we will bring this breakthrough to the patients who need it most. **Together, we can make “no-option” patients a thing of the past.**
